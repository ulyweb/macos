To map or access a network folder or SMB share in macOS using the terminal, you can use the following methods:

1. Using the `mount` command:

```bash
mkdir ~/mountpoint
mount -t smbfs //username@server/share ~/mountpoint
```

Replace "username", "server", "share", and "mountpoint" with your specific details.

2. Using the `open` command:

```bash
open "smb://username@server/share"
```

This method will open the network share in Finder.

3. For more complex setups, especially if connecting to an Active Directory domain:

```bash
mount_smbfs //'DOMAIN;username'@server.example.com/share ~/mountpoint
```

Replace "DOMAIN", "username", "server.example.com", "share", and "mountpoint" as needed.

When using these commands:
- You'll be prompted for a password if required.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the share.
- The mountpoint directory should exist before mounting.

To unmount the share:

```bash
umount ~/mountpoint
```

Remember to replace "mountpoint" with the actual directory name you used.

To install an installer .pkg file using the macOS terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo installer -pkg /path/to/your/package.pkg -target /
```

Replace "/path/to/your/package.pkg" with the actual path to your .pkg file. This command will install the package to the root directory (/).

If you want to install the package without entering your password each time, you can use:

```bash
echo "your_admin_password" | sudo -S installer -pkg /path/to/your/package.pkg -target /
```

However, be cautious with this method as it may expose your password in the command history.

For a more secure approach, you can also use:

```bash
sudo installer -allowUntrusted -verboseR -pkg /path/to/your/package.pkg -target /
```

This command allows for untrusted packages and provides verbose output during installation.

Remember that you'll need administrator privileges to install most .pkg files. If you don't have admin access, you can install to your home directory using:

```bash
installer -pkg /path/to/your/package.pkg -target ~
```

# Change Hostname on macOS via Terminal

To change your Mac's hostname using the Terminal, use the following command:

```bash
sudo scutil --set HostName NEW_HOSTNAME
```
Replace `NEW_HOSTNAME` with your desired hostname.

For example:
```bash
sudo scutil --set HostName mynewmac
```
You will be prompted to enter your administrator password.

## Additional Useful Commands

- **Set LocalHostName** (used for Bonjour services):
  ```bash
  sudo scutil --set LocalHostName NEW_LOCALHOSTNAME
  ```

- **Set ComputerName** (the name that appears on the Mac and in the Finder):
  ```bash
  sudo scutil --set ComputerName NEW_COMPUTERNAME
  ```

## Check Current Hostname

To verify your hostname after changing it, use:
```bash
scutil --get HostName
```

> Changing the hostname may require restarting your Mac or logging out and back in for all changes to be fully applied.

This issue stems from a **bug or undocumented behavior** in `sysadminctl` on recent macOS versions (particularly Sonoma and later). Even though `-fullName` is documented, it currently behaves incorrectly **when passed inline** with `-addUser`.

---

## âœ… Solution: Use `dscl` Instead to Create User Properly

You can still create a full-featured user (with GUI login support) and grant SecureToken access â€” just use the more reliable `dscl` approach, then assign SecureToken.

---

### ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step: Add User via `dscl` and Grant SecureToken

### **1. Create Local User Account via `dscl`**

```bash
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal UserShell /bin/zsh
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal RealName "Test Local"
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal UniqueID "505"
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal PrimaryGroupID 20
sudo dscl . -create /Users/testlocal NFSHomeDirectory /Users/testlocal
sudo dscl . -passwd /Users/testlocal MySecurePass123
sudo createhomedir -c -u testlocal > /dev/null
```

> âœ… Pick a `UniqueID` that doesn't conflict (check with `dscl . -list /Users UniqueID`).

---

### **2. (Optional) Make the User an Admin**

```bash
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a testlocal -t user admin
```

---

### **3. Grant SecureToken to New User**

This must be done by an existing **SecureToken-enabled** admin:

```bash
sudo sysadminctl -secureTokenOn testlocal -password MySecurePass123 -adminUser EXISTINGADMIN -adminPassword EXISTINGADMINPASSWORD
```

**Example:**

```bash
sudo sysadminctl -secureTokenOn testlocal -password MySecurePass123 -adminUser johnadmin -adminPassword Secret123!
```

---

### **4. (Optional) Add to FileVault Unlock List**

```bash
sudo fdesetup add -usertoadd testlocal -user johnadmin -password Secret123!
```

---

## âœ… Confirm It Works

```bash
sysadminctl -secureTokenStatus testlocal
```

---


Despite being **documented**, the `-fullName` flag fails in recent macOS versions when passed directly. Itâ€™s likely an **undocumented parsing bug** or restriction. Appleâ€™s tools have trended toward more **MDM-focused user creation**, and `dscl` remains the most reliable for local scripts.

---

To list all users who are part of the **admin group** on macOS via Terminal, run the following command:

```bash
dscl . -read /Groups/admin GroupMembership
```

### âœ… Output Example:

```
GroupMembership: root johnadmin testlocal
```

This lists all user short names who have **admin privileges**.

---

### ðŸ§ª Alternative: Using `id` to Check a Specific User

To see if a specific user is in the `admin` group:

```bash
id username
```

Example:

```bash
id testlocal
```

Look for `admin` in the `groups=` list (usually group `80`).
