If the `openssl s_client` test works but `brew install google-cloud-sdk` still throws the `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error, it means that **Homebrew is not picking up the custom CA certificate** properly. Here’s why that might be happening and how to fix it.

---

### **Possible Reasons & Fixes**

#### **1. Homebrew Uses a Different OpenSSL Version**
Homebrew uses its own version of OpenSSL (`/usr/local/etc/openssl@3` on Intel Macs, `/opt/homebrew/etc/openssl@3` on Apple Silicon). Your `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable might not apply to Homebrew’s OpenSSL.

✅ **Fix**: Manually tell Homebrew to use the correct certificate:
```bash
export HOMEBREW_CURLRC=1
echo "cacert=$SSL_CERT_FILE" >> ~/.curlrc
```
Then, try installing again:
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```
This ensures that Homebrew’s `curl` and OpenSSL use your custom CA.

---

#### **2. Homebrew Uses `curl` Instead of OpenSSL**
Homebrew relies on `curl` for downloading packages, and it might be ignoring `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

✅ **Fix**: Tell Homebrew’s `curl` to use the custom CA:
```bash
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
```
Test if `brew` picks it up:
```bash
brew fetch google-cloud-sdk
```
If that works, retry:
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```

---

#### **3. Homebrew Needs a Custom OpenSSL CA Directory**
Instead of a single `SSL_CERT_FILE`, Homebrew may expect a **directory** of CA certificates.

✅ **Fix**: Convert your `.pem` file into a CA directory:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.certs
cp ~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem ~/.certs/
c_rehash ~/.certs
export SSL_CERT_DIR=~/.certs
```
Then retry the installation.

---

#### **4. Homebrew’s Python Might Be Ignoring the Certificate**
If Homebrew installs Python-based packages (like `google-cloud-sdk`), its Python might not use `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

✅ **Fix**: Set Python’s cert path manually:
```bash
export PIP_CERT=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
```
Then, retry:
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```

---

### **Persistent Fix (Make It Permanent)**
If one of the above solutions works, make it permanent by adding the successful commands to your `~/.zshrc` (for macOS default shell) or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
echo 'export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PIP_CERT=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### **Final Check**
If you still get errors, run:
```bash
brew doctor
echo $SSL_CERT_FILE
openssl s_client -connect raw.githubusercontent.com:443 -CAfile $SSL_CERT_FILE
brew fetch google-cloud-sdk
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```
