Since the download works but **installing the Cask (`install.sh`) fails due to SSL errors**, it means that **Google Cloud SDK's installer script is not respecting the environment variables you set**. The script likely invokes its own version of `Python`, `curl`, or `OpenSSL` that does not use your system's CA settings.

### **Fix for Google Cloud SDK Installation SSL Errors**

#### **1. Manually Install Google Cloud SDK Instead of Using Homebrew**
If Homebrew's Cask install is failing, try installing Google Cloud SDK manually using the official installer:

```bash
curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-sdk-$(curl -s https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/components-2.json | jq -r '.version')-darwin-arm.tar.gz
tar -xvzf google-cloud-sdk-*.tar.gz
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```
If `install.sh` still throws SSL errors, proceed with the fixes below.

---

#### **2. Set the SSL Certificate for Google Cloud SDK’s Python**
Google Cloud SDK uses its own embedded **Python runtime**, which might ignore `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

✅ **Fix**: Run:
```bash
export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES=1
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
```
Then, retry:
```bash
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```

---

#### **3. Force Google Cloud SDK to Use System Python**
If it still fails, force `install.sh` to use your system’s Python instead of its bundled one:

✅ **Fix**:  
```bash
export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=python3
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
```
Then run:
```bash
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```

---

#### **4. Modify the Installer Script to Use Your CA**
If none of the above works, open the `install.sh` file and find where it sets up Python.

```bash
nano google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```
Look for a line that sets `PYTHON` and change it to:
```bash
export PYTHON=python3
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem
```
Then, **save and exit** (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER`), and retry:
```bash
./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
```

---

### **Final Steps (Make It Persistent)**
If installation succeeds, make sure the SDK continues working by adding these lines to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
echo 'export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES=1' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
For `bash`:
```bash
echo 'export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/certs/Intuitive-python-cacert-bundle.pem' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON_SITEPACKAGES=1' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### **Summary of Fixes**
1. **Manually install Google Cloud SDK** instead of using Homebrew (`install.sh` might be using a different CA setting).
2. **Set `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` before running `install.sh`**.
3. **Force `install.sh` to use system Python** by setting `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=python3`.
4. **Edit `install.sh` to use your CA manually** if all else fails.
5. **Make settings permanent** by adding them to `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`.
